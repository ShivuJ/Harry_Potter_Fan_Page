                        battle for glory among three wizarding schools—the Triwizard Tournament.
                        But since Harry never submitted his name for the Tournament, who did?
                        Now Harry must confront a deadly dragon, fierce water demons and an enchanted maze only to find

                        it can to keep the wizarding world from knowing the truth – including appointing Ministry
                        official Dolores Umbridge as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts. When
                        Umbridge refuses to teach practical defensive magic, Ron and Hermione convince Harry to secretly
                        train a select group of students for the wizarding war that lies ahead. A terrifying showdown
                        between good and evil awaits in this enthralling film version of the fifth novel in J.K.
